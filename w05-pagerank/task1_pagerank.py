"""Week 5 · Task 1 — PageRank, and the two ways it breaks.

Textbook §5.1 (PageRank), §5.1.3 (dead ends), §5.1.4 (spider traps).

PageRank is a random surfer following links forever, and the rank of a page is
how often the surfer is there. As one line of linear algebra it is
`r = M r`, and as written it does not work on the actual web.

Two structures break it, and the fix for both is the same one line. Build the
broken version first so you can see each failure, then fix it.
